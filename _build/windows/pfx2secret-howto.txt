Hereâ€™s how to convert a PFX file into a Base64 encoded string.

Powershell:
certutil -encode 'path\certificate.pfx' 'path\certificate_base64.txt'

The above line can be executed from Power Shell.
It will convert the PFX input file into TXT base64 string and save it out somewhere on your drive.
Take contents of that file, and store it in GitHub Secrets.


In a GitHub Action, this is how to save the GitHub Secret as a .pfx file:

Powershell:
New-Item -ItemType directory -Path certificate
Set-Content -Path certificate\certificate.txt -Value '${{ secrets.WINDOWS_CODESIGN_CERTIFICATE }}'
certutil -decode certificate\certificate.txt ${{ env.CERTIFICATE_PFX }}
